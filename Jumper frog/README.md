### Game - main objects and components
#### Spawners
* We created 3 spawns object, we placed 2 of them on the right side of the game screen and one on the left side of the game. We created 2 types of spawning components:
  * [CarSpawner.cs](https://github.com/OdeliaHochman/Computer-Games-Development-Course-task2/blob/master/Jumper%20frog/Assets/Scripts/CarSpawner.cs)
  Spawning prefabs that give him left to right screen.
  * [CarSpawnerLeft2Right.cs](https://github.com/OdeliaHochman/Computer-Games-Development-Course-task2/blob/master/Jumper%20frog/Assets/Scripts/CarSpawnerLeft2Right.cs)
  Spawning prefabs that give him right to left screen.
* The objects that the spawners spawn are destroyed as they reach the screen boundaries.

#### Frog
* We created two types of triggers for objects with coliders [Frog.cs](https://github.com/OdeliaHochman/Computer-Games-Development-Course-task2/blob/master/Jumper%20frog/Assets/Scripts/Frog.cs):
  * If the frog collides with a vehicle it is dead (destroyed) - a loss.

  * If the frog did not crash into any vehicles and managed to reach the forest (crash into the trees) the spiders are destroyed - a victory.
