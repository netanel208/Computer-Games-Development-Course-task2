* [Life](https://github.com/OdeliaHochman/Computer-Games-Development-Course-task2/blob/master/collisions/Assets/Scripts/3-collisions/DestroyOnTrigger2D.cs) - The player's spaceship is not destroyed immediately when it hits the enemy, but at the beginning of the game it has 3 life points. Only when it reaches zero is it destroyed.
